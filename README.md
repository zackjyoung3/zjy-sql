# zjy-sql

## Initial Project Definition

### Purpose

- **Project Goal:**  
  To create an in-memory SQL database written in **C++**.

- **Background:**  
  In college, I developed an in-memory SQL database in Python. That project allowed me to dive deep into various aspects of DBMS implementationâ€”from query parsing and tokenization to optimization and executing plans against an internal data store.

- **Objectives for the C++ Implementation:**  
  1. **Performance & Memory Efficiency:**  
     Leverage C++'s low-level control and high-performance capabilities to build a more efficient implementation with a lower memory footprint.
  
  2. **Deepening Language Mastery:**  
     Use this project as an opportunity to deepen my understanding of modern C++ practices, design patterns, and advanced features.
  
  3. **Advanced Query Optimization:**  
     Explore query optimization strategies that were beyond the scope of my previous Python implementation. The initial Python version only implemented basic optimizations (e.g., for Sort-Merge rather than Nested Loop joins). With C++, there is room to push these optimizations further.

### Outline

1. **Parser Identification:**  
   - **Define a Subset of SQL Grammar:**  
     Choose an initial subset of SQL grammar that the system will support.
   - **Select Data Types:**  
     Determine the initial set of data types that the database will handle.

2. **SQL Query Parsing and Tokenization:**  
   - **Tokenization:**  
     Develop routines to tokenize SQL queries.
   - **Parsing:**  
     Build a parser that processes the tokenized queries based on the defined SQL grammar.

3. **Data Types, Schemas, and Tabular Data Handling:**  
   - **Type Handling:**  
     Define how various data types are represented and validated in the system.
   - **Schema Enforcement:**  
     Develop mechanisms to enforce schema rules on the input data.
   - **Tabular Data Storage:**  
     Design an efficient, in-memory data structure to store tables.  
     *(Hint: Consider lightweight data structures that can later facilitate query optimization.)*

4. **Developing Interfaces and Utilities:**  
   - **Interface Design:**  
     Create clear interfaces for type handling, schema enforcement, and data manipulation.
   - **Data I/O Utilities:**  
     Implement utilities for:
     - Populating data from different source formats (e.g., Parquet, JSON, CSV)
     - Writing data back to various file formats (e.g., Parquet, JSON, CSV)
   - **Reference Implementations:**  
     Look into existing libraries (such as Apache Arrow for columnar data representation) that might serve as inspiration or components.

5. **Query Execution Engine:**  
   - **Execution Routines:**  
     Develop routines that execute queries based on the condensed SQL grammar.
   - **Optimization Techniques:**  
     Integrate advanced optimization strategies during query execution to improve performance.

6. **Iterative Expansion and Refinement:**  
   - **Incremental Development:**  
     Gradually expand the supported SQL grammar, additional data types, and optimizations.
   - **Performance Tuning:**  
     Continuously profile and refine the implementation to ensure high performance and efficient memory usage.
   - **Feature Expansion:**  
     Over time, incorporate more complex SQL features and query execution paths.
